👋 Hi, I'm Aaron

I'm a Computer Science student with a strong focus in cybersecurity, computer architecture, and hardware-level security. I enjoy building projects that bridge software and hardware—whether that's writing assembly, experimenting with secure boot processes, or creating tools that help others learn.

**What I work with:**
- 🛡️ Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking (TryHackMe, Security fundamentals)
- ⚙️ Assembly, C, Python
- 🖥️ Linux (Ubuntu servers & virtualization)
- 🔧 Hardware + low-level computing

**Current goals:**
- Earning my Associate Degree in Computer Science
- Building a portfolio of security-oriented tools and labs
- Working toward government-level cybersecurity roles

If you’d like to collaborate, feel free to reach out!
